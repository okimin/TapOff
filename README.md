# TapOff

This is a simple Tapping application that serves to have additional features implemented for more interactivity.
Current plans are as follows:
- Add a daily leaderboard to showcase users who can tap the most in 30 secs
- Add a multiplayer game aspect to the application
- Players can search for other players to be matched
- Players will tap as much as they can within 20 seconds then choose a range of numbers to null the taps from the other player 
- Add a leaderboard base on Win/Loss/Draw ratio
